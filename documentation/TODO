#ToDo
1) Add in Doppler mask on acquisition for high CN0 SVs. This will prevent the acquisition from picking up cross correlations.					COMPLETE 
2) Move inline assembly to plain assembly source for better compilation compatability					
3) Fix PVT solution ending up as a NaN in some cases																							COMPLETE 
4) Add in almanac decoding																														COMPLETE 
5) Create "sat-select" routine that will use the almanac and PVT to find visible SVs and their expected Doppler (enhances acquisition)			COMPLETE 
6) Create a simple Kalman filter to put on top of the PVT solution
7) Found another measurement error, a jump in the 1ms epoch occurs (possibly a double-rollover condition?)										COMPLETE 
8) Implement a simple RAIM
9) Dump ephemerides to disk to speed up the warm start mode
10) Self calibrate the thresholds for the acquisition using a dummy PRN
