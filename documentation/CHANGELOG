Added cross correlation check in PVT, dumps ephemerides and channels resulting from cross-corrs


04/24/2008:	3.0.10a:

Fixed PLL issue, was due to the fact that I was feeding in the phase error in radians, not cycles as the filter expects.
I added in FLL and PLL lock detectors (low-passed versions of the fll and pll disciminators), ultimately the PLL will fall back to FLL if the
PLL lock indicator becomes too large, but I need to think of a good algorithm. I also adjust the correlation length based on the CN0 estimate
now, instead of defaulting to 20 ms once frame lock is achieved. Changed the way the channel "navigate" flag works, instead of being true when bit_lock, 
frame_lock, and z_lock are all high, it is set to true once z_lock is achieved, and can never be reversed. However, setting satellites seem to 
feed in too many bad measurements as the channel loses lock, and causes the V part of the PVT solution to end up as NaN. I need to added in some logic to exclude
the channel quickly once lock is lost. Also a OSX user tried to compile the receiver, the SIMD code borks, complaining about using the %ebx register in
the assembly. I need to put the SIMD code into normal assembly files, this will help cross compatability.


04/28/2008: 3.0.11a:

Worked more on the PLL/FLL transition. Added in an instantaneous power check for the navigate flag in the channels. Added a new logfile, "satellites"
which is a log do fthe SV positions and time. Noticed a divergence in the PVT when during a test with the rooftop antenna, looking into cause. Added in
a lock indicator in the ncurses output (f or p, prior to the BFN sequence). Added a simple RAIM algorithm that minimizes the pseudorange residuals if 
5 or more SVs are currently being tracked.


05/1/2008: 3.0.12a:

Removed RAIM for now, made PVT unstable. Added a 10 measurement delay to verify channel health for use in PVT, found in TakeMeasurement() in correlator.cpp.
Also fixed the ICP measurement to be proper, ie the ICP is the average over -1/2dt and +1/2dt from the pseudorange snapshot, instead of -1dt to 0dt
(which leads to a velocity measurement biased by the pseudorange acceleration).


05/05/2008 3.0.13a

Added in GPSTime in PVT.cpp, outputs the GPS second in the week from the system clock. This initializes the clock when the PVT object is created.
Also added the ability to read in a YUMA almanac file in Ephemeris.cpp, this is in preparation for a SV predict routine to help drive the acquisition process, 
which from my car experiment is a needed feature!


05/12/2008 3.0.14a

After reading more about the DBS-RX I changed the default values in usrp_sdr.cpp. By widening the Max2118's filter from 2 MHz to 10 MHz the phase noise 
in the down-conversion greatly decreases. Previously the max CN0 you would see would be 46 dB-Hz, now CN0's on the order of 53 dB-Hz are estimated. Also a partial
implementation of almanac decoding is complete, changes found in ephemeris.cpp.


05/14/2008 3.0.15a

Added in Doppler mask to acquisition to help prevent acquisition of cross correlations from high CN0 SVs. Most interesting I was acquiring and tracking cross
correlations from SVs from MEDIUM signal acquisitions! Whoa! Changes found in channel.cpp and acquisition.cpp. Added a routine called init_agc to quickly initialize
the AGC instead of slowly converging, found in misc.cpp. Also tracking.cpp was renamed sat_select.cpp in preperation for the warm-start/almanac directed
acquisition.


05/27/2008 3.0.16a

SV_Select.cpp completed! Simple model calculates elevation mask based on earth blockage (function of altitude). Also added in ability to perform a warm start. This requires
that the file current.alm and lastpvt.txt reside in the directory of execution. current.alm is a YUMA format almanac available from the site 
http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/GPS/almanacs.htm. The warm start requires that the PC clock is close to UTC and the time zone is set correctly. The warm start
can be enabled with the "-w" flag to the executable. Note that if the almanac or pvt load fails then the receiver will fall back to a cold start mode, 
which is the default behaviour.


05/28/2008 3.0.17a

Added self calibration for acquisition thresholds via search of a dummy PRN. Thresholds will be set to mean(power) + std(power), which should limit false acquisitions to 15%
while maximizing the probability of detection. Fixed warm/hot start modes, warm acquisition indicates the almanac is used for visibility only, whereas hot uses the almanac
for visibility AND to predict the doppler range. Added in dump of ephemeris to a file for faster warm start.
