#ToDo
1) Add in Doppler mask on acquisition for high CN0 SVs. This will prevent the acquisition from picking up cross correlations.
2) Move inline assembly to plain assembly source for better compilation compatability
3) Fix PVT solution ending up as a NaN in some cases
4) Add in almanac decoding
5) Create "sat-select" routine that will use the almanac and PVT to find visible SVs and their expected Doppler (enhances acquisition)
6) Create a simple Kalman filter to put on top of the PVT solution
7) Found another measurement error, a jump in the 1ms epoch occurs (possibly a double-rollover condition?)
8) Do a simple RAIM
